- Hi, I’m foof
- I’m a gamedev, writer, and visual artist who loves creating stories and worlds! I occasionally work on small game projects and haven't really found anything big to focus on.
- I’m relatively experienced in python, kotlin, and mcfunction. I know a little bit of c#, but not enough to do anyhting with lol
- Contact me via discord (foof#3527) - I will link an email eventually
